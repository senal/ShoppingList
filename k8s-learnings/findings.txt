--- Pods ----------------
-------------------------

1. If following errors when deploying locally
    ErrImagePull, ErrImageNeverPull, ImagePullBackOff 
    This is due to pods deployment try to pull images from docker hub which is not correct in local deployment sa we haven't push them in to docker hub
    In order solving this issue.
    ---------------------------------------
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: shopservice
          image: shoppinglist/shopservice:0.0.1
          imagePullPolicy: Never

    Add imagePullPolicy: Never in to your <pod-name>.yaml file.
    Note: Please keep in mind that we are not deploying pods individually. This is just to show this error

2. crashloopbackoff error.
    This is due to your container inside in your pods didn't start crorrectly. could be crashed in the startup.
    Check for logs.
        e.g kubctl logs <pod-name>
    Worth running the container locally in order see what's going on inside.

    ----- NGNIX Ingress controller----
    ----------------------------  
    https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#provider-specific-steps

    ------------------------------------------
    --------- IMPORTANT NOTE -----------------

    Ingress 
    It's important to create a ingress controller applying the following config
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v0.47.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml

    Also note that, whenever you restart or recreate your cluster, above configurations will be deleted hence re-running the above configuration is required.

4. .NET projects do not required 'UseHttpsRedirection'. However, when running the application in a container, things like proper HTTPS configuration are in the hosting environmentâ€™s responsibility (eg. Kubernetes, Azure Container Instances, or the App Services runtime).
