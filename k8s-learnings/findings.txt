--- Pods ----------------
-------------------------

1. If following errors when deploying locally
    ErrImagePull, ErrImageNeverPull, ImagePullBackOff 
    This is due to pods deployment try to pull images from docker hub which is not correct in local deployment sa we haven't push them in to docker hub
    In order solving this issue.
    ---------------------------------------
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: shopservice
          image: shoppinglist/shopservice:0.0.1
          imagePullPolicy: Never

    Add imagePullPolicy: Never in to your <pod-name>.yaml file.
    Note: Please keep in mind that we are not deploying pods individually. This is just to show this error

2. crashloopbackoff error.
    This is due to your container inside in your pods didn't start crorrectly. could be crashed in the startup.
    Check for logs.
        e.g kubctl logs <pod-name>
    Worth running the container locally in order see what's going on inside.
