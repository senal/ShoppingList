------- Services -----------
----------------------------

Provids networking between pods.
also allow access to pods from outside world.

--- Types of Services ---
1. Cluster  IP: Sets up an easy-to-remember URL to access a pod. Only exposes pods in the cluster. ( This can be used to internal communication )
2. Node Port: Makes a pod accessible from outside the cluster. Usually only used for dev purposes. 
3. Load Balancer:  Makes a pod accessible from outside the cluster. This is the right way to expose a pod to the outside world.
4. External Name: Redirects an in-cluster request to a CNAME url (No need to worry about this one.)
